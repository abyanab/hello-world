# hello-world
This is my first time learning GitHub.

I'm starting to learn about computer programming in August 2020.
Other than learning how to code, I feel like it is also necessary to learn GitHub to know how to make projects made by other people and to follow up new trends in the field I want to learn.
I hope this is a long time learning and become part of my life journey.
